#JavaJam

JavaJam is a project I worked on through the help of a work book for my Multimedia & Web class. This project was over a course of 5 weeks working on it a little bit at a time. I wish I would have remembered to uploaded this project and push'd to the repo over time. However, the end project is here and I'm just glad I could help distribute to others and maybe encourage someone along the way to keep learning. Become a better programmer, developer or whatever makes you tick or pays the bills.
